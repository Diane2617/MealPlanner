        <h1>Welcome to the Meal Planner!</h1>

        <p>I can take the headache out of deciding what to cook. You may choose how you want me to generate 
            your meal. Choose how you would like your meals generated from the navigation bar or using the links below.
            <ul>
            <li><a href="standard">Standard Meal</a> - these meals consist of a protein, two sides and a vegetable</li>
            <li><a href="custom">Custom Structured Meal</a> - you choose how many sides and vegetables you wish to include in your meal</li>
            <li><a href="yourbuild">Your Build</a> - input your preferred choices for each category and the number of choices to 
                be included in each meal. Your meals will be generated based on this</li>
            </ul>   
            So go ahead, lets get you some meals!  </p>
