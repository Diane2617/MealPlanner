 Careful how storing passwords, and usernames, emails. 
 Administrator user name and password so that I can access database
 two 
 1. SQL -  older, more structured way for storing and access data
 2. non SQL - not as structured,

 make distinction between user info and meal info

 approach 1 - using tables

 approach 2 - a document for each user

 find python connector library for database

 {% if users %}
<ul>
</ul>
{% endif %}
{% if kenny.sick %}
    Kenny is sick.
{% elif kenny.dead %}
    You killed Kenny!  You bastard!!!
{% else %}
    Kenny looks okay --- so far
{% endif %}
