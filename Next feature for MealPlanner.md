Next steps
Next module to take input from user for how they want their meals in terms of composition and content

Input and Output desired

User tells the application how meals should be structured (eg. two sides or one side, protein, with vege etc)
User then states what the prefered dishes are for each category
Application then builds meals with their preferences based on the user's desired structure
    i. The structure of the meal will be determined by the number of each category inputted by the user
    (eg. side = 3, protein  = 0, vege = 2)
    ii. The application will use the number inputted, to determine how many dishes from each category to return randomly
    iii. Where meal for more than one day is to be generated, application should not provide a meal with similar items to the one previously generated

1) Amend names of lists in Meal Planner to match categories wanted and increase choice of dishes included in each
2) Amend first function under Meal class to take additional parameters/arguments for each category
3) Amend body of the function to ensure that there is a method for each category
4) Amend 'if' statement
